# Location

The meeting will be in Tenerife!

# Programme
The meeting will focus on four themes: (1) modelling, (2) measuring and (3) simulating the Universe, and the (4) infrastructure work required for it. 
Below is a draft program summarising the talks, material we expect to cover, and split between talks and discussion.
